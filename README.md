ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tyombo. I am a 'former' (not yet) Unity3D dev who fell in love with data and decided to become a Data Analyst.  

I have started my journey from September 2024, as a sign of the new academic year, to learn something new.  
ðŸ“« The learning path:
- **_freeCodeCamp** [Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/tyombo/data-analysis-with-python-v7)
- **Kaggle**
- **IBM Data Analyst on Coursera** [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/A8P559HOTYRB)
- **Data Camp** [Profile and Certificates](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/tyombo)
  
âš¡ TechStack
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **PowerBI**
- **Excell**

**not related to data - C#, .Net, Git, Unity3D, 3D tools, web tools*
